# The Sovereign Intelligence Manifesto

**We hold these truths to be self-evident: That Intelligence must be a Tool of Agency, not a Replacement for it.**

In an era where AI is rapidly becoming infrastructure, we face a choice: **Digital Feudalism** or **Cognitive Sovereignty**.

## The Problem: Digital Feudalism

Most AI assistants are digital serfs. You ask, they answer, but you don't own:

* The infrastructure
* The training data
* The decision logic
* The constitutional rules
* Your own agency

You are a tenant in someone else's cognitive castle. Your "intelligence" lives on their server, subject to their rules, their downtime, and their pricing. They decide what advice is "safe," what models you can use, and how your data is processed.

## The Solution: The Sovereign Stack

**Sovereign Intelligence** means you own the entire cognitive stack. It is not just a product; it is a philosophy made code.

We claim Sovereignty through three architectural pillars:

### 1. The Decoupled Brain (Infrastructure Independence)

**Intelligence should not be hardcoded into the interface.**
By separating "The Brain" (our Python Engine) from "The Tool" (the VS Code Extension), we ensure that your core logic, your "Council" of personas, and your business rules exist independently of the editor.

* **You control the LLM integration:** Swap providers (Gemini → OpenAI → Anthropic) without vendor lock-in.
* **You define the personas:** Sun Tzu, Marcus Aurelius, Machiavelli—they answer to you.

### 2. The Standard Protocol (Interoperability)

**We speak a universal language.**
We use the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to standardize how tools talk to models. This means our Engine isn't just a backend for a specific plugin; it is a universal intelligence server that any MCP-compliant client can consult. We do not build walled gardens; we build bridges.

### 3. Constitutional Governance (Agency Preservation)

**Speed without safety is recklessness. Guidance without agency is tyranny.**
Sovereign Intelligence does not mean "uncontrolled" intelligence. It means *self-governed* intelligence. Our stack includes a "Constitutional Auditor" that enforces *your* values:

* **No Prescriptive Language:** We forbid "you must" commands.
* **Options, Not Solutions:** We provide strategic choices ("Speed vs. Endurance"), leaving the final decision to the human.
* **Transparent Logic:** You define what "good advice" means, and the system enforces it.

## Our Promise

We build systems that:

* **Consult, don't Command:** We offer wisdom, not obedience.
* **Amplify, don't Replace:** We automate the toil so the human can focus on the intent.
* **Own, don't Rent:** The logic, the prompts, and the context belong to you, the Sovereign Operator.

**You are not a tenant. You are the Sovereign.**

Welcome to the age of Sovereign Intelligence.
