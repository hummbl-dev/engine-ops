# Sovereign Intelligence Launch Assets

## 1. Hacker News Submission

**Title Options:**

1. Show HN: Sovereign Intelligence – A Constitutional Firewall for AI Assistants
2. I built a Glass-Box AI that enforces *my* rules, not the vendor’s
3. Sovereign Intelligence: Escaping Digital Feudalism with a Transparent, Auditable Stack

**Body:**
The **Sovereign Intelligence Stack** is a fully-open, vendor-agnostic AI platform that puts *human agency* back in the driver’s seat.

* **Kill-Sheet diagram** (high-contrast, dark-mode ready) shows the stark contrast between feudal black-box AI and our transparent, rule-based architecture.
* **Demo screencast** (≈30s) visualizes a blocked transformation due to friction, then resolves it after an epistemic “foundation” step—showing the physics of our D-T Framework in action.
* **All components are decoupled**: a Python/Rust brain (`engine/`), a VS Code extension (`extension/`), and a universal MCP protocol for model routing.

👉 **Read the full README** for a quick start, or clone the repo and run the demo script: `engine/dt_framework/demo_screencast.sh`.

**TL;DR** – Own your AI, audit every decision, and stay vendor-agnostic.

🧵 I built a firewall for my mind.

1/ 🤖 Most AI assistants are black boxes. You never see *why* they suggest something, you can’t control the output, and there’s no audit trail. That’s digital feudalism.

2/ ⚡ Introducing the **Sovereign Intelligence Stack** – a constitutional, glass-box AI that enforces *your* rules, not the vendor’s.

**Tweet 3/7:**
3/ 📊 **Kill-Sheet** (see image) visualizes the stark contrast:
🔴 Feudal AI → Black Box, Vendor-Lock-In, No Transparency.
🟢 Sovereign AI → Constitution, D-T Framework, Full Audit.

**Tweet 4/7:**
4/ 🎬 **Demo screencast** (30s) shows a transformation blocked by friction, then resolved after an epistemic “foundation” step. It’s the physics of our D-T Framework in action.

**Tweet 5/7:**
5/ 🛠️ All components are decoupled:
* **Engine** (Python/Rust) – stateless reasoning core.
* **Extension** (VS Code) – universal MCP client.
* **Constitution** – YAML-defined safety rails & agency policies.

**Tweet 6/7:**
6/ 🚀 Get started in minutes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummbl-dev/engine-ops.git
cd engine-ops
./scripts/demo_screencast.sh
```

## 3. Proof-of-Life Blurb (Video Description)

**Sovereign Intelligence – Proof of Life**

This 30-second demo shows the **D-T Framework** in action: a transformation attempt is blocked by high friction (the “Feudal” state). After an **Epistemic** accretion step, friction drops to zero and the transformation succeeds, illustrating how our system enforces *human-defined* constraints and automatically propagates beneficial ripples.

*Watch the demo, then explore the full stack on GitHub.*
