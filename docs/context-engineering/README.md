# Context Engineering System

**Welcome to the Engine-Ops Context Engineering System.**

This directory contains the frameworks, templates, and standards used to maintain high-fidelity context across the project lifecycle.

## 📚 Core Frameworks

- **[Project Organization](PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md):** Repository structure, governance, and decision-making models.
- **[Security Praxis](SECURITY_PRAXIS.md):** Security standards, secure coding guidelines, and compliance.
- **[Computational Context](COMPUTATIONAL_CONTEXT.md):** Strategy for logging, metrics, and state management.

## 📝 Operational Templates

- **[SITREP Template](SITREP_TEMPLATE.md):** Standard format for weekly or incident-based Situation Reports.
- **[AAR Template](AAR_TEMPLATE.md):** After Action Report template for retrospectives.

## 🛠️ GitHub Integration

We have integrated context engineering into our GitHub workflow:

- **Issue Templates:** Standardized bug reports, feature requests, and context gaps.
- **PR Template:** Enforces context updates and verification.

## 🔄 The Context Cycle

1.  **Observe:** Use Computational Context (Logs/Metrics) to understand system state.
2.  **Orient:** Use SITREPs to align team understanding.
3.  **Decide:** Use Governance models to make decisions.
4.  **Act:** Use PRs and Issue tracking to execute changes.
5.  **Analyze:** Use AARs to learn from outcomes and update context.
