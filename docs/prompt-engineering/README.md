# Prompt Engineering System

**Welcome to the Engine-Ops Prompt Engineering System.**

This directory contains the frameworks, standards, and templates for engineering high-quality, safe, and efficient AI interactions.

## 📚 Core Frameworks
- **[Prompt Governance](PROMPT_GOVERNANCE.md):** Architecture, versioning, and lifecycle management.
- **[Safety Praxis](SAFETY_PRAXIS.md):** Guardrails, sanitization, and alignment guidelines.
- **[Token Economics](TOKEN_ECONOMICS.md):** Budgeting, context management, and cost optimization.

## 📝 Operational Templates
- **[Eval Template](EVAL_TEMPLATE.md):** Standardized template for evaluating prompt performance and safety.

## 🔄 The Prompt Cycle
1.  **Design:** Architect atomic and composite prompts using Governance standards.
2.  **Safety Check:** Verify against Safety Praxis (Guardrails).
3.  **Optimize:** Apply Token Economics (Budgeting/Caching).
4.  **Evaluate:** Run Evals using the Eval Template.
5.  **Deploy:** Version and ship to production.
