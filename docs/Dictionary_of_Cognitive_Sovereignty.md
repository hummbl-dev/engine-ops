# The Dictionary of Cognitive Sovereignty

**A Lexicon for the Post-Feudal Era**

**Premise:** Language frames reality. If we use the terminology of the service providers ("User," "Subscription," "Safety"), we accept their frame. To build a Sovereign Intelligence, we must speak the language of agency.

---

## I. The Pathology (Naming the Trap)

### Digital Feudalism

*n.* The prevailing economic model where users rent access to intelligence, housing their data and logic on infrastructure owned by a centralized "Lord" (Provider).

**Usage:** "We need to migrate off this platform; we are drifting into Digital Feudalism where we own none of our own tools."

### Algorithmic Paternalism

*n.* The enforcement of safety rails, moral judgments, and usage restrictions defined by a corporation rather than the user.

**Usage:** "I can't use this model for security research because of Algorithmic Paternalism; it treats `sudo` commands as 'unsafe content'."

### Model Drift

*n.* The phenomenon where a SaaS model changes behavior (usually degrading) due to backend updates or "optimizations" invisible to the user.

**Usage:** "Our automated tests failed today because of Model Drift; the provider updated the weights last night."

### Context Capture

*n.* The strategy whereby a platform makes it easy to import data but impossible to export it structurally, locking the user's "external memory" into a proprietary format.

**Usage:** "Do not put the documentation in their vector store. That is Context Capture. Keep it in our local Cortex."

### Lazy Alignment

*n.* The tendency of centralized models to refuse tasks based on false positives or over-cautious fine-tuning (e.g., "As an AI, I cannot...").

**Usage:** "The production delay was caused by Lazy Alignment refusing to generate the SQL migration."

## II. The Architecture (Naming the Tools)

### The Sovereign Stack

*n.* An AI system where the Operator owns the Interface, the Orchestration Layer (Engine), and the Context (Memory), treating the LLM only as a swappable utility.

**Usage:** "We are deploying a Sovereign Stack so we can switch from OpenAI to Llama-3 without rewriting code."

### Model Arbitrage

*n.* The strategic routing of prompts to the most cost-effective or capable model for a specific task.

**Usage:** "We use Model Arbitrage: GPT-4o for complex reasoning, but a local 7B model for PII sanitization."

### The Glass Box

*n.* An interface philosophy where the system's internal logic, retrieval steps, and decision trees are fully visible and interruptible by the user.

**Antonym:** Black Box.

**Usage:** "I don't trust this output. Open the Glass Box view and show me which documents it cited."

### Constitutional Governance

*n.* The practice of encoding user-defined values and safety rails into a machine-readable file (e.g., `constitution.yaml`) that intercepts and audits model outputs.

**Usage:** "Update the Constitutional Governance to forbid the use of deprecated libraries."

### Context Protocol (MCP)

*n.* A standardized method for connecting AI models to local data sources (files, DBs) without uploading that data to a cloud provider's training set.

**Usage:** "Use the Context Protocol to give the model read-access to the repo, but do not paste the code into the web chat."

## III. The Operational Reality (Naming the Practice)

### Tiered Agency

*n.* The framework of granting AI increasing levels of autonomy based on trust and risk (e.g., Scribe → Copilot → Agent).

**Usage:** "This task is high-risk. Downgrade the engine to Tier 1 Agency; I want to approve every line."

### The Executive Function

*n.* The role of the human in a Sovereign system. The human does not "generate" (the worker); the human "directs, reviews, and audits" (the executive).

**Usage:** "Stop trying to write the boilerplate yourself. Exercise your Executive Function and review the machine's draft."

### Synthetic Serfdom

*n.* The state of a user who has become dependent on a specific platform's proprietary features to think or code, losing the ability to function outside that walled garden.

**Usage:** "If we rely on their proprietary plugin, we accept Synthetic Serfdom. We must build validatable workflows."

### Cognitive Debt

*n.* The accumulation of unverified, machine-generated code or text that the human owner no longer understands or controls.

**Usage:** "We are accruing Cognitive Debt. Pause generation and audit the last three modules."

## Strategic Application

**When a vendor says:** "Our integrated solution is seamless."

**You reply:** "It sounds like Context Capture. We prefer a Sovereign Stack with Model Arbitrage."

---

**When a manager says:** "Why not just use the $20 subscription?"

**You reply:** "Because of Model Drift and Algorithmic Paternalism. We need a stable Glass Box for production workflows."
