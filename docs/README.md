# Sovereign Intelligence Documentation Index

This directory contains the complete philosophical, strategic, and technical foundation for the Sovereign Intelligence Stack.

## Core Philosophy

### [MANIFESTO.md](../MANIFESTO.md)

The foundational declaration of Cognitive Sovereignty. Defines the three pillars: Decoupled Brain, Universal Protocol, and Constitutional Governance.

### [DIALECTIC.md](DIALECTIC.md)

A Hegelian dialectic analysis presenting the Thesis (Sovereign Intelligence), Antithesis (Algorithmic Paternalism), and Synthesis (The Augmented Sovereign Model).

## Strategic Assets

### [STRATEGIC_COMPARISON.md](STRATEGIC_COMPARISON.md)

A decision matrix comparing Digital Feudalism (SaaS) vs. Sovereign Intelligence. Answers the question: "Why build instead of rent?"

Key differentiators:

- Model Drift vs. Version Pinning
- Generic Safety vs. Contextual Safety
- Intelligence Arbitrage

## Implementation Guides

### [config/sovereign_constitution.yaml](../config/sovereign_constitution.yaml)

The executable configuration governing the Sovereign Engine. Defines:

- Infrastructure routing rules (multi-provider)
- Constitutional directives (agency preservation, transparency, data sovereignty)
- Escalation protocols (tiered agency)

### [UX_SPEC.md](UX_SPEC.md)

The interface specification for the "Glass Box" Sovereign Control Plane. Describes:

- The Agency Governor (Manual/Copilot/Autopilot dial)
- The Thought Stream (visible AI reasoning)
- The Context HUD (MCP connection graph)
- The Break Glass Button (kill switch)

## Case Studies

### [case-studies/THE_DELETION.md](case-studies/THE_DELETION.md)

A narrative scenario demonstrating how the Sovereign Stack prevents "Competent Recklessness" through Constitutional Governance and MCP context awareness.

## Operational Documentation

### [context-engineering.md](context-engineering.md)

Current state of the repository, technology stack, and recent achievements.

### [prompt-engineering/SAFETY_PRAXIS.md](prompt-engineering/SAFETY_PRAXIS.md)

Safety and alignment guidelines, including Council persona definitions and agency preservation rules.
